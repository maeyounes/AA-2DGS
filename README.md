## AA-2DGS: Anti-Aliased 2D Gaussian Splatting
This repository will soon contain the implementation of AA-2DGS, an antialiased 2D Gaussian Splatting method that eliminates aliasing artifacts due to camera zoom, distances and varying fields of view by introducing a world-space flat smoothing kernel and object-space Mip filtering, preserving geometric accuracy while enabling high-quality rendering at arbitrary sampling rates.
